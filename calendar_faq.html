				<br>
				By July 1st of every year, all districts are required to submit calendars for the<br>
				coming year. <br>
				<br>
				Greg Johnson must approve all calendar changes before they are entered into DART.<br>
				<br>
				<b>How can I print the school calendar?</b><br>
				<br>
				See the <a href="printing_tips_pop.html">Printing Tips</a> page.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is required for a school year calendar?<br>
					<br>
				</b>A school year shall include not less that 180 days in session unless, with the approval of the commissioner. </font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">A  day used for in-service training of teachers can substituted for a day in session, up to a maximum of 10 days. Only Greg can approve this change.</font></p>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">There must be a minimum of 170 student days/ days for instruction.<br>
				<br>
				<b>What is the difference between an Student Day and a Student Contact Day?<br>
				</b><br>
				Each day within the school term is a day in session except Saturdays, Sundays,<br>
				and days designated as holidays.</font></p>

		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Although Inservice Days count toward the required number of Student Days, they are not used to calculate the Attendance Rate because there is no student contact.  <br>
				<br>
				Days of Enrollment include any Student Day, as well as Inservice days, so these numbers are used for count to calculate enrolllment. <br>

		<blockquote>
			<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Average Daily Membership (ADM):</b> Includes student and inservice days <br>
					<b>Average Daily Atttendance (ADA):</b> Includes student contact days only <br>
				</font></p>
		</blockquote>
		<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">In addition, certain days will sometimes be approved as Work Days (W), even though students are not in school. These count toward teacher contract requirements, but do not toward any credit for student or school calendar days.<br>

				<br>
				<b>What are the minimum hours of a school day?<br>
					<br>
				</b>The day in session shall be at least four (4) hours long, <i>exclusive of intermissions</i>, for<br>
				the first, second, and third grades and five (5) hours long,<i> exclusive of intermissions</i>, for all other grades. <br>
				<br>
				This means the minimum hours required can't include recess, lunch and so on ;-)</font></p>

		<p><font size="3" face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>What are my options for making-up for an &#147;emergency closure day&#148;?<br>
				</b><br>
				Greg has to approve all changes, and submit them to Alaska EED.<br>
				<br>
				Basically, you may add a day at the end of the school year, request your school board to approve Saturday school, change a vacation day to a student day or possibly substitute an in-service day for a school day. <br>
