ABOUT DOCUMENTATION: This is just a first stab at organizing documentation for
the DART system. The wiki pages, and Eduforge site will hopefully soon
have a group of users who can help in providing more detailed instructions,
as well as feedback on how DART can be most easily be documented.

To install the DART system:

Requirements:
-------------
- DART uses Pdftk to create PDF files. You need to install Pdftk before using 
DART (see http://www.pdflabs.com/docs/install-pdftk/)

- DART uses a MySql database, you need to provide the name of a existing 
database and user, and the installer will create the tables

Installation:
-------------
- Put all components in a directory that is assessible by a web browser running 
php/mysql. 

- Create folders to use the SMARTY template system (Smarty (www.smarty.net) is 
already included in the source folder). Follow these instructions in a command console:
$> cd smarty
$> mkdir templates_c
$> mkdir cache
$> mkdir configs
# templates_c and cache have to be writtable by Apache. For instance, you can do:
$> chown _www:_mysql templates_c
$> chown _www:_mysql cache
$> chmod 775 templates_c
$> chmod 775 cache
$> cd ..

- Give permissions to other special files and folders: 
# exp and exp/tmp.pdf have to be writtable by Apache. For instance, you can do:
$> chown _www:_mysql exp
$> chown _www:_mysql exp/tmp.pdf

- If you want to test the system with a sample database, you have to download it from 
https://dartdemo2.bssd.org/downloads/sample.sql and save it in the install folder

- Open the index file in a browser. Eg: http://localhost:8888/DART/index.php

- Follow the page instructions to install DART. This will create the tables in 
the database and the config/config.ini file. This file can be later modified to 
set up other configuration parameters, such as the installation path of Pdftk

Starting to use DART:
--------------------
A good order to set things up is:

- Create School:
  Admin > Dictionaries > District School (index.php?cmd=sitesEdit)

- Add information to the start page of each shool: You can an Important, 
Warning and Tip message to be displayed in the start page, for users where
this privilege is granted (see "Set Privileges")
  Admin > Notes > Site Notes (index.php?cmd=editNotes)

- Create Grading System: You can skip this step if you wnat to use the existing 
systems
  Admin > Grading Scales (index.php?cmd=editgs)

- Assign Grading System:
systems
  Admin > Grading Scales > Edit Site Grades, select site and then click 
"New Grade Schedule For Site" (index.php?cmd=editsite)

- Create Courses (Subjects): You can create your own courses and/or use the
existing ones.
  Admin > Dictionaries > Courses > Create Subjects (index.php?cmd=createsubject)

- Create Levels for each subject (you need to create levels for the existing
subjects before you can enroll students)
  Admin > Dictionaries > Courses (index.php?cmd=createlevels)

- Create Standards for each subject and level (you need to create standards for the existing
subjects before you can enroll students)

  Admin > Dictionaries > Create, Delete and Rename (index.php?cmd=standardManipulation)

- Add Information to Standards: Select standard and add shortname, description 
and link to curriculum
  Admin > Dictionaries > Create, Standards (index.php?cmd=editStandards)

- Add Students & Add Student Information
  Admin > Manage Admin, select site and then click New Student (index.php?cmd=userAdmin&status=Active)

- Enroll Students to Levels: You can do this right after adding a new student, or 
later by choosing "Edit Student Information" from the drop-down menu at the top of
any page

- Add Teachers and Administrators: You have to assign them to schools or districtwide
  Admin > Manage Admin (index.php?cmd=userAdmin&site=Admin&status=Active)
First select school, then click "New Teacher" or "New Admin". Right after 
creating a new user, you need to set their privileges (they are created without 
any privileges)

- Set Privileges for users: You can set privileges (none, school-wide for 
teachers or district-wide for wide staff/admins to see all schools) for each 
functionality, or use the template profiles at the bottom of the page. 
  Admin > Manage Admin (index.php?cmd=userAdmin&site=Admin&status=Active)
First select school, then locate the user and click "Privileges"

- Search for and form groups: Groups are the center of how users interact with 
the site. The documentation on BSSD's wiki site and the GitHub site has
some nice basics on creating groups already posted.
  Students > Search for Students (index.php?cmd=search)
